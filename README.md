# polarization-scattered-light
This repository contains my work from "Diagnostics from Polarization of Scattered Optical Light from Galactic Infrared Cirrus" (Bowes & Martin, 2023, ApJ, 959, 40).

Most of the calculations were done in the "ScatteredLightPolarization" notebook, although "ScatteredLightPolarization_mollweideplotting" was used as well. These were wrote in Jupyter to be modular, for ease of use for trying out mixing different illuminations, dust models, passbands, cirrus location, etc.

A disclaimer: this repository has extraneous code, and some code that may have been used to write text files has been removed; many text files in this repository are also redundant or were not used in the final results. 

This notebook is not to be taken as whole and complete, but rather can give you a very solid foundation for how the results were calculated in order to proceed with your own calculations.
